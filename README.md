# CollectionLogDiscordBot

Adds the capability for a discord group to fill a collection log as a team. Images are built at runtime to fill the collection log.

![Zulrah log](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/780844572989194270/781811430948339732/colImage.png)

Then doing "!log add uncut onyx" would result in this:

## Bank

To view the bank attached to the collection log do:

!log bank

which would return something like
